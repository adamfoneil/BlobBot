What if you needed to execute some kind of custom processing on blobs uploaded to Azure Storage that, inconveniently, couldn't be done online? For example due to machine-specific requirements or unusual dependencies that can't be setup reliably in the cloud? What if you wanted to do this processing from several machines to benefit from parallel processing, with robust tracking and logging? This project is a framework for doing this.

- The heart of it is an abstract class [BlobBotClientBase](https://github.com/adamfoneil/BlobBot/blob/master/BlobBot.Client/BlobBotClientBase.cs). This is based on [BackgroundService](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.hosting.backgroundservice?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0). You would implement the [ProcessBlobAsync](https://github.com/adamfoneil/BlobBot/blob/master/BlobBot.Client/BlobBotClientBase.cs#L49) method, along with several other methods, while the base class handles the downloading and process tracking.

- I envision using Azure Event Grid to track newly created blobs in a database [table](https://github.com/adamfoneil/BlobBot/blob/master/BlobBot.Shared/Models/BlobInfo.cs#L21), but really you could track them anywhere so long as that destination implements [IBlobInfo](https://github.com/adamfoneil/BlobBot/blob/master/BlobBot.Shared/Interfaces/IBlobInfo.cs#L13).
